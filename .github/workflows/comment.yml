# By calling this ci via `workflow_call` from another ci it has permissions to comment on prs from forks
# This action expects the a artifact named `content` to be present in the workflow run
# If the artifact contains a pr_number.txt, the action will comment on that pr. If not it comments on the commit.
# The content of the messages composed by concatinating all *.txt files within content into a single file
# If you want to enforce a specific order, you need to name the files in a way that sorts in the desired order
